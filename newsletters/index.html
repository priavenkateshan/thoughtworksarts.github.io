				<p>ThoughtWorks Arts new San Francisco based residency has been awarded to a team of three artists working across media with a focus on remote collaboration and distributed story-telling.</p>

</figure>

<p>During their residency, Max Razdow, Ollie Razdow, and Jamie Zigelbaum will work together developing a generative story-telling project, titled, <em>All Possible Pathways</em>. The project is a science fiction based narrative concerning A.I.’s future, co-authored and illustrated by Zigelbaum and M. Razdow and input into a decentralized public blockchain ledger. The blockchain based text will then be recomposed by O. Razdow through software coded at ThoughtWorks Arts in San Francisco. It will output an audio visual interpretation that changes each time it appears. The artists believe their work both informs and challenges the relationship between AI, its democratization, and its social impacts.</p>

<p>The team will also receive additional support from both <a href="https://snark.art/">SnarkArt</a> and <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Max Razdow</strong> is an artist, writer, and teacher living in Boston, MA.  He has taught art practice and theory at New York University, University of Massachusetts and Lesley University, and has shown his drawings and text based works internationally, and co-founded the online art theory journal Speculative Arts Research.</p>

<p><strong>Ollie Razdow</strong> is a programmer and electronic musician. Starting his journey in the world of music, he moved into programming by implementing sound synthesis programs from scratch. Moving on to a degree in computer science, from Boston University, he is now working on an interpreted language for sound synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Jamie Zigelbaum</strong> is an artist, designer, and engineer living in New York and Spain. He was the founding director of Midnight Commercial, a creative studio working across disciplines. In 2010, he received the Designer of the Future award from Design Miami/ Basel. He holds a Masters in Media Arts and Science from the MIT Media Lab.</p>

<p>The residency is scheduled to begin in San Francisco at the end of September, and will conclude at the end of January.  Stay tuned for updates and insights on their developing project.</p>

<p>The 2019 installment of <a href=https://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/2019-james-and-audrey-foster-prize>ICA’s Biennial - James and Audrey Foster Prize exhibition</a>, will showcase the work of four Boston-area artists, including ThoughtWorks Arts current volumetric filmmaking resident, Rashin Fahandej</p>

<p>Rashin’s multi-platform, community engaged interactive volumetric work, <em>A Father’s Lullaby</em> underscores the role of men in raising children and their absence due to the racial disparities in the criminal justice system with its direct impact on children, women and lower income communities.
On Thu, Sep 26, at 7:00 PM Rashin and the other featured artists will come together for a public conversation at <a href="https://www.icaboston.org/">ICA</a>, on life as visual artists, and to hear about their creative practices. Music and other activities are also planned throughout the evening to celebrate the exhibition.</p>

<h2 id=hardware-hack-lab-opens-at-thoughtworks-in-barcelona-spain>Hardware Hack Lab Opens at ThoughtWorks in Barcelona, Spain</h2>
<p>An offshoot of the Hardware Hack Lab, which began in New York in 2013 is now live in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<p>The event which offers space, emerging tech and support (and dinner!) to the public for free has sparked many interesting collaborations among members over the years. New members are encouraged to bring a project, a toy, an idea, or to simply come in and see what others are doing.</p>

<p>We look forward to including Barcelona’s community in this program. Hardware Hack Lab Barcelona will meet at the ThoughtWorks offices at Edifici Media-TIC Carrer de Roc Boronat 117, 8ª Planta, 08018 Barcelona, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Hardware-Hack-Lab-BCN/">every other Wednesday at 6:30 PM</a></p>

<h2 id=former-ai-resident-karen-palmer-to-exhibit-perception-io-at-cooper-hewitt-design-museum-in-nyc>Former AI Resident Karen Palmer to Exhibit <em>Perception iO</em> at Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in NYC</h2>

<p>Artist Karen Palmer (TWA’18) who works in facial recognition and AI will be exhibiting her recent project <em>Perception iO</em> at the <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/events/current-exhibitions/upcoming-exhibitions/">Cooper Hewitt Design Museum</a> in NYC on September 20th.</p>

">
		

	

	
</figure>

<p><em>Perception iO</em> is a facial emotion detection and eye tracking immersive film. Karen teamed up with a dedicated team of programmers at ThoughtWorks to develop <em>Perception iO</em>, and to integrate the <a href="https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/nano/">Tobii Pro</a> eye gazing hardware into her installation.</p>

<p>The project explores the intersection of AI, neuroscience, behavioral psychology, film, facial emotion detection, eye tracking, bias, and social justice. The immersive storytelling experience reveals how a person’s gaze and emotions influence their perception of reality. Participants are invited  to analyze the data they calibrate in their mind to become aware of their subconscious behavior, implicit bias’ and the bias’ of AI networks.</p>

<p><em>Perception iO</em> is an evolution of <em>RIOT</em>, the project Karen developed during her residency at ThoughtWorks.</p>

<p>Blockchains and AI are revolutionary technologies that will imminently change how humans and industry exist forever.</p>

<p>Currently the two are somewhat separate, except in niche crypto currency applications. But SingularityNET’s CEO, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJrtpwgQozw&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be">Dr. Ben Goertze</a>l, sees their widespread combined potential and set out to create a system that not only captures the power of AI, but one that also is open to absolutely everyone, ensuring that AI is transparent and decentralized.</p>

<p>It was this idea of individuals having better access and insight to AI development that became the inspiration of our residency’s key theme. We’re so excited to now have SingularityNet on board. and look forward to exploring creative approaches to the implementation of a decentralized AI through a unique art work for this upcoming residency.</p>

<p>This open call is also in collaboration with our other partner <a href="https://snark.art/">Snark.Art</a>, a developer of blockchain for art.</p>

<p>Our open call for The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain is still open and ends on July 31st. The residency will take place  September 30th, 2019 — January 31, 2020.</p>

<p>The film was shot on location at the <a href="https://consortiumrr.com/">Consortium for Research &amp; Robotics</a>, hosted by the Pratt Institute in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Her film features their 16ft tall industrial robotic arm. It also features a non-humanoid robot called <a href="https://mekamon.com/">MekaMon</a>, manufactured by <a href="https://reachrobotics.com/">Reach Robotics</a> in the UK, and explores a narrative on technological transformations and humanity as we advance into the 4th industrial revolution. Elements of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” also swirl into the film’s theme, adding a poignant juxtaposition.</p>

<p>Adrianne Wortzel is an artist whose works include tele-robotic/robotic performance productions, interactive installations, photography, videos, art objects and writings. Her works display the arc of human experience of technological advances as they emerge, become pervasive, and eventually obsolete.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Adrianne and her project on <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/adrianne-wortzel/">her resident page</a>, and <a href=https://vimeo.com/329474208>watch a teaser of the film on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Her screening of The Sentient Thespian will start at 7:15 on Wednesday, July 17th. There will be a reception starting at 5:30. Address: 32 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003. Tickets available at the door.</p>

<p><strong>Moon Ribas</strong> recently had her seismic sensors removed from her feet. After seven years of sensing earthquakes as a cyborg, she’s now learning how to adjust to life without seismic activity registering in her physiology. However, Moon has reported to be experiencing phantom movements, confusing her nervous system.</p>

<p>“I’ve started to experience how it feels to lack a cybernetic sense and I’m now feeling phantom earthquakes. How long will these last? Will the extraction of the cybernetic organ affect my identity? Am I a phantom cyborg now? “ - Moon Ribas</p>

<p>Moon is curious to see how this transition plays out, while looking forward to experiencing movement through new forms in the future.</p>

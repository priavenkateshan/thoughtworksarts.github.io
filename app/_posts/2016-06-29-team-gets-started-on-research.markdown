Moving on from our successful <a href="/blog/visioning-session-with-the-cyborgs/">visioning session</a>, the team has started to coalesce around tasks. At this early stage that means research and experimentation, along with the creation of simple test rigs to measure results.

In this post, we'll look at the progress of the team engineering Neil Harbisson's new "time sense". Let's start with a review of what Neil imagines this new sensory organ to be.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

Neil wants to create a new sense of time, which will essentially allow him to perceive the 24-hr clock as an internal sense. To do this, Neil wants to feel time as heat sensations around the circumference of his head.

The endgame for this project is to create a permanent implant, which will be installed via surgery. However, during this residency we will be dealing with an earlier phase of this project. As [with Neil's antenna implant](/blog/introducing-cyborg-foundation/), the first iteration will be an 'exo-sense' &mdash; an external sensory organ, or wearable sense.

Neil likes to draw a sharp distinction between a wearable and an exo-sense. According to Neil, an exo-sense is unlike a wearable in that it is designed to be worn permanently &mdash; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, forever &mdash; or until you upgrade. In Neil and Moon's case, their exo-senses are preludes to an upgrade to a permanent implant.

This constant use prompts the formation of the psychological 'mirror' to the sensory implant. The repeated instinctual, automatic interactions with the implant by the wearer eventually lead to full integration with personal experience, much like natural senses such as sight and touch.

Together, the manufactured sensory organ and personal psychology combine to form a new sense. When the organ is a permanent, internal implant you have a [cybernetic organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg) &mdash; a cyborg.

Once manufactured, Neil will wear the exo-sense for a prolonged period of time, allowing the team to learn, adjust and prepare for the permanent implant.

Right now we are at the very beginning of this project. Before we can create the wearable exo-sense, we must experiment with the candidate implementations we have in mind, and discover the properties of the components we are considering using.

The favorite plan at the moment is to position resistors around the head and apply [pulse-width modulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) current to create a 'moment of heat' in each resistor, with a gentle incline and decline.

In this way the sensation of time-as-heat, we believe, will pass smoothly around the head. Placed densely enough, each moment of heat will overlap, creating a relatively seamless experience.

To begin experimenting, we need a testing mechanism. Testing this will involve at least two streams:

1. Testing individual resistors for their thermal response to applied current, and
2. Testing the behavior of resistors collectively, in position around the head

Initially these tests will take place on the mannequin heads. However, soon we will also test on Neil's head. When this moment comes, each resistor will be located in physiologically distinct areas of the head, and therefore may respond differently to the same application of current.

It is important for us to be able to compare the sensations Neil reports feeling with our test outputs from the collection of resistors, to help us learn and adjust. We need a test rig which allows us to do this on a human, as well as a mannequin head.

To do this, Sam and Oryan have been experimenting with a [thermal camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermographic_camera). Thermal cameras read infra-red radiation, which gives us an indication of heat over an image area. Inset to the picture above is an initial test shot with the camera.

Using the online service [Infragram](http://infragram.org/), the team is able to position a mouse cursor over an RGB image, and take a reading of the same pixel from the thermal camera. In this way, the team can test the changes in temperature as they apply voltages to resistors around the circumference of the dummy head, and ultimately Neil's head.

At the same time, the team also needs to know how various individual resistors respond to different applications of current. Initially, the team ran tests applying current directly to a variety of resistors, with the results illustrated below.

This week, Kelvin has been working on testing [nichrome wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichrome), which acts as a resistor and could be a good candidate material.

Kelvin has written Arduino code to apply pulse-width modulated current to the nichrome, and a Python script to parse and display the resulting temperatures over the serial port over time. You can see the full codebase at [kr0/Arduino-PyPlot](https://github.com/kr0/Arduino-PyPlot).

The illustration above shows the ambient temperature response in red, alongside the contact temperature response in blue. (Is this right? What does contact and ambient even mean??)

With these test rigs in place, and these experiments underway, the team is ready to start designing prototypes based on acquired knowledge. There is more ground to cover in the component and material research, however we are steadily moving toward the exo-sense. Stay tuned for more updates.

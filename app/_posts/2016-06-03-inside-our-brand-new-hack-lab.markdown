This week we have been building out our new lab space here in New York. The lab is intended for use internally, as well as for public use during community events.

The lab provides facilities for exploring new hardware and emerging technologies. It features three new VR stations with powerful computers, a hardware prototyping station, and an array of equipment: everything from 3D video to Brain-Computer Interfaces.

Attendees to our weekly, public <a href="https://hardwarehacklab.io/">Hardware Hack Lab</a> can use this space to explore emerging technologies in a social setting. In addition, our annual <a href="https://artahack.io/">Art-A-Hack</a> program now has a consistent home in which to bring projects to fruition.

Internally, our developers and designers are assessing various emerging technologies for their potential impact on our clients. At the same time, we are undertaking tactical projects to help us explore the technical, experiential and social patterns made possible by the tech.

As initiatives and engagements continue to crop up, having a consistent location to explore emerging tech helps us to build a culture, and to share that culture via public and community engagement.

Artists who take part in the Arts Residency program will have direct access to the lab whenever they need it. Our <a href="/blog/introducing-cyborg-foundation/">current residents</a>, the Cyborg Foundation, have begun working with engineers who recently graduated from New York University's <a href="http://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">ITP program</a>, and these engineers will also have full access to the lab.

What we are really excited about is seeing what happens next. We have built the space, and are working on a number of very exciting projects concurrently. Watch this space, and <a href="https://hardwarehacklab.io/join/">consider visiting</a> one of our public events.

Dilate Ensemble is an audio-visual collective featuring Carole Kim (California), Gloria Damijan (Vienna), Scott L. Miller (Minnesota), Luisa Muhr (New York) and Jon Raskin (California).

In April 2020, Carole Kim compressed her work in video installation to fit beneath her kitchen table, creating an intimate live "venue," and invited Gloria, Scott, Luisa and Jon to work with Kim’s live visuals in a form of interactive improvisation-based dialogue. Work is collaboratively developed, involving a shared visual element delivered over Zoom.

Netty-McNetface is used to mix the audio in Scott's studio, where he processes the audio tracks in Kyma—monitored by the ensemble in Netty—and OBS to produce live audiovisual work which is streamed. Dilate has embraced the latent nature of telematic performance, developing an artistic practice idiomatic to the venue of networked audio-visual art.

Karen Palmer is a London-based digital filmmaker and storyteller, whose immersive films combine the genres of film, gaming, art, science and technology.

Her work has been honored as part of the Digital Dozen Break Throughs in Storytelling 2016, and exhibited at the V&A Museum London, Museum of Modern Art Peru, The Future of Storytelling Festival NY and The Festival of the Mind Sheffield. Karen has presented her ideas at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIpeUdKK2-4">TEDx Australia</a> at the Sydney Opera House.

Karen's prototype 'RIOT' is an emotionally responsive, live-action film, which uses A.I. and Machine Learning through facial recognition to allow viewers to navigate though a dangerous riot in progress. The film's narrative changes in real-time in response to subtle changes in each viewer's reaction to events.

The project went on to be featured by global broadcasters including <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/06/16/impulse-response/">CBS</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/mar/29/its-a-riot-the-stressful-ai-simulation-built-to-understand-your-emotions">Guardian</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3066396/this-film-lets-you-know-how-you-would-handle-yourself-in-a-riot">Fast Company</a>, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/facial-recognition-technology-raises-privacy-concerns-n676836">NBC</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/nyregion/storytelling-in-the-virtual-age-at-fost-fest.html">New York Times</a>.

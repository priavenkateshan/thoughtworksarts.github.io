Catie Cuan is a performer, choreographer, filmmaker, and technologist. She is interested in the physical manifestations of digital identities and the friction between discrete structures and qualitative human phenomena.

Catie is a 2018 TED Resident and the Artist-in-Residence at the Robotics, Automation, and Dance (RAD) Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her collaboration with the RAD Lab and Director Amy LaViers has resulted in numerous publications, a commercialization avenue, and a performance work, titled "Time to Compile". Previous and upcoming performances of "Time to Compile" include the Ferst Center (Atlanta), MOCO (Genoa), CODAME (San Francisco), the Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces (Providence), Biennial Symposium (New London), and Joe's Pub/Dance NOW (New York). Elements of this work have been funded by the National Science Foundation, resulting in an early experimental model of a simultaneous performance work and human-robot interaction study.

She has performed with the Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, and in numerous Off-Broadway projects.

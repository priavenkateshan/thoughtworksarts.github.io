Rashin Fahandej is an Iranian-American multimedia artist and filmmaker. Her projects center on marginalized voices, and the role of media, technology, and public collaboration in generating social change. A proponent of “Art as Ecosystem,” Rashin defines her projects as “Poetic Cyber Movement for Social Justice,” where art mobilizes a plethora of voices by creating connections between public places and virtual spaces.

Rashin is the founder of *A Father’s Lullaby*, a multi-platform, co-creative project that highlights the role of men in raising children and their absence due to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. *Marginalia*, a series of poetic documentaries about Baha’i immigrants of Iranian descent, narrates a historical persecution in their homeland.

Rashin has served as an artistic director of the Rebuilding the Gwozdziec Synagogue at POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, 2017 Boston Artist-In-Residence with Mayor’s office of art and culture and 2018 Public Art Resident at Boston Center for the Arts. She is a research fellow at MIT Open Documentary Lab and the 2019 Mass Cultural Council Artist Fellow, Artist in Residence at ThoughtWork Arts and the Institute of Contemporary Arts in Boston James and a recipient of the Audrey Foster Prize.

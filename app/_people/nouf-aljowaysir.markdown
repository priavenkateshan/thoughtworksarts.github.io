Nouf is a Saudi-born, New York-based artist, creative coder and lead AI researcher at Havas New York. Her work focuses on the impact of current and emerging technologies on society, ranging from interactive physical installations to political Twitter bots. With a light sense of humor and irony, Nouf's projects criticize how rapid technological advances have become a means of domination, control, and exploitation.

Her work has been shown in galleries and festivals in the US and Europe, including the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), SXSW in 2019, and was selected for a Sundance New Frontier Story Lab Residency.

At Havas, Nouf is researching and developing artificially intelligent prototypes as tools for design. She has an M.P.S. degree from NYUâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program and a background that spans 3D dimensional design and architecture.

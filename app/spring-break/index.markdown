The work of ThoughtWorks Arts artists were exhibited together at the closely-watched SPRING/BREAK Art Show in March 2018. The exhibition took place at 4 Times Square as part of New York's Armory Week.

The exhibition, sponsored by the media art center [Harvestworks](http://www.harvestworks.org/), was comprised of works incubated by ThoughtWorks Arts programs over the last four years. This includes work from [Art-A-Hack](https://artahack.io) and the [ThoughtWorks Arts Residency](https://thoughtworksarts.io), and by the directors of these programs, who are also practicing artists.

The show’s curator Lee Tusman, says:
> These works show the tipping point of innovation socially transforming our world over the next 25-30 years. They cross over into areas of virtuality and nature and the artificial and the real. As the real (nature/climate change) is threatened, the artificial (VR/AR/immersion) grows. As one world is being destroyed, another opens up.

The exhibited works are listed below, each showcasing the intersection between art, technology and society.

## Dual Brains
Dual Brains is a [real-time visual performance](https://artahack.io/projects/dual-brains/) of the brain data of two performers who are wearing 3D-printed brainwave headsets. The work was incubated as part of Art-A-Hack 2016, and first performed at ThoughtWorks New York.

The work showcases shared empathy between two brains, creating a visual and sonic environment.

First conceptualized by artist Eva Lee, the piece uses custom EEG headsets created by 3D fashion designer Aaron Trocola. The software behind the performance was [extended and refined](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/Dual_Brains) for the exhibition by ThoughtWorks developer Julien Deswaef.

## RIOT
RIOT is an [emotionally responsive, live-action film](/blog/karen-palmer-ai-residency/) with 3D sound, which uses facial expression recognition technology to navigate through a dangerous riot in progress. In the experience, audience’s emotions are used to adjust the story of the film, so that our emotions drive the narrative of the film forwards.

This project has been incubated as part of artist Karen Palmer’s 2017 residency at ThoughtWorks. During this time a [new version of the emotion analysis engine](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/EmoPy) and [RIOT user experience](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/riot) have been built from the ground up by ThoughtWorks developers.

## Suppressed Images

Suppressed Images is a [graphic short story](/projects/suppressed-images/) exploring the implications and issues around DNA, identity and genetic surveillance, and imagining what future might unfold.

The story focuses on a collaboration between the then-incarcerated whistleblower Chelsea Manning and artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg. In 2015, Chelsea sent a cheek swab from inside military prison, which Heather subjected to DNA analysis. A 3D-printed portrait was produced based on the DNA.

Illustrated by ThoughtWorks graphic illustrator Shoili Kanungo, the story outlines this collaboration and explores societal and social issues surrounding the use of DNA analysis technology.

The piece was created as part of Heather’s residency at ThoughtWorks in 2016, and can be viewed online at [Suppressed Images](https://suppressedimages.net/).

## Biofields
Biofields is an [open-source framework prototype](/projects/biofields/) combining biosensors measuring heart rate and breath with custom volumetric and interval arithmetic simulations to “interactively model the elusive feeling of energy around the body.” The prototype was presented as a virtual reality experience during the exhibition.

   caption='The \'Biofields\' virtual reality experience' %}

The piece is a collaboration between artist hannes bend and designer and technologist Lewey Geselowitz. The project was initiated as part of hannes’ 2017 residency at ThoughtWorks.

## Noor: A Brain Opera
Noor is an [immersive brain opera](https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/wnpm3w/eeg-brainwave-opera-hong-kong) where a performer launches video, a sonic environment, and a libretto through her brainwaves. The piece was created by ThoughtWorks Arts director Ellen Pearlman to raise questions about the future of brain-computer interface technology.

Featured in the ThoughtWorks Arts exhibition was documentation of a major showing in a in 360-degree theatre in Hong Kong. The piece asks “Is there a place in human consciousness where surveillance cannot go?”

## Emergency Room
Emergency Room is an [immersive media installation](https://jahya.net/works/emergency-room/) comparing global warming to a chronic health crisis. The piece was created by ThoughtWorks Arts director Andrew McWilliams.

   caption='A shot of the installation \'Emergency Room\'' %}

The work uses custom-created algorithms which develop a story in real-time based on a databank of video clips related to planetary environmental chaos, activism and the causes, effects and potential remedies to climate change.

## Utopia 1.0: Post Neo-Futurist-Capitalism
Utopia 1.0  is a [first-person expedition](https://artahack.io/projects/utopia/) to Second Life, the once thriving virtual 3D online world, in search of what remains. The film was shot ‘on location’ within Second Life by filmmaker Annie Berman.

   caption='Utopia 1.0: Post Neo-Futurist-Capitalism' %}

The film shows ruins that do not decay, speculative real estate, realtors' offices, wide open spaces with 'for sale' signs, Harvard University’s virtual ‘sandbox’, and an art gallery on its last days.

In a satirical nod to current techno-utopian hype around virtuality, Annie led an Art-A-Hack team to develop a virtual reality version of her film experience, which was presented at this exhibition.

## To Be With Hamlet
To Be With Hamlet is the [world's first live-action telepresence](https://artahack.io/projects/hamlet-vr/) production of Shakespeare via virtual reality. This project, whose initial creation was incubated by Art-A-Hack, went on to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017.

{% include image.html file='to-be-with-hamlet.jpg'
   caption='An audience member explores \'To Be With Hamlet\'' %}

Actors in remote locations interact with audience members via live microphone feeds, motion capture and real-time telepresence technology. Audiences together watch a live scene, able to move freely about the scene and view the actors from any angle.

The work was conceptualized and created by Javier Molina and David Gochfeld with the support of NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

## Relativity Five
Relativity Five is a table-top heart sensing and reflecting light sculpture by artist Sofy Yuditskaya. The work is an extension of a [concept incubated at Art-A-Hack](https://artahack.io/projects/aurora-borealis/), in which lasers are used to display viewer’s biometrics.

This work magnifies and immerses audiences in their own bodily rhythms, with their heartbeats pulsing in laser form as they touch buttons on the sculptures.

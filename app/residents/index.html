	<p>Each season of the program we support one resident for a 16-week cycle. We are delighted to have worked with influential artists working on a range of important contemporary issues.</p>
	<p>As residents progress through their projects week by week, updates are posted to the <a href="/blog/">blog</a>. At the completion of each residency, the project is added to the <a href="/projects/">projects archive</a>, which documents activity and any outcomes.</p>

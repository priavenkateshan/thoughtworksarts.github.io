<p> During her ThoughtWorks Arts Residency, Karen will be furthering development of her interactive film, RIOT. This project is an emotionally responsive live-action film with 3D sound, and uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, machine learning, and facial recognition to allow users to navigate through a dangerous riot in progress.</p>

<p>The RIOT prototype was recently honored as part of the Digital Dozen Break Throughs in Storytelling 2016, and has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art Peru, Future of Storytelling Festival NY and Festival of the Mind Sheffield. The project went on to be featured by global broadcasters including CBS, Guardian, Fast Company, NBC and the New York Times.</p>

<h2>AI Residency Finalists</h2>
<p>We reviewed sixty three exceptional applications for the AI residency from artists all over the world, from which four finalists were selected. We'd like to extend special thanks to the following finalists who shared their work with us.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shirin.works/">Shirin Anlen</a>, an Israeli interactive creator working at the intersection of technology and exploratory arts. Her work looks at issues of mental illnesses, and how they apply to AI, and how we can use virtual reality and avatars to explore the nature of AI systems and their responses.</p>

<p><strong>Olento Collective</strong>, Jani Hietanen, Jaana Ristola and Ismo Torvinen, are working on a new theory of aesthetic motion. Their implementation is a new form of emotional AI, providing machines the ability to recognize the emotional content of embodied motion in a new way.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.disnovation.org">Disnovation</a></strong>, a working group based in Paris, initiated by Nicolas Maigret and Maria Roszkowska. Their work is somewhere between contemporary art, research and hacking. The collective develops situations of disturbance, speculation, and debate, challenging the ideology of innovation and stimulating the emergence of alternative narratives.<br/> </p>

<h2>Meet Our Artist Residents</h2>
We’re excited to have Heather Dewey-Hagborg <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/introducing-heather-dewey-hagborg/">join us</a> as ThoughtWorks’ newest artist resident. Heather is an artist and researcher known for her work highlighting the implications of DNA as data.<br>
<br>
During her time at ThoughtWorks, Heather intends to begin a new body of work, currently named Sell/Bio, in which she will research the “histories, infrastructures, protocols and business models” that position DNA as a “commodity to be bought and sold on the open market.”<br>

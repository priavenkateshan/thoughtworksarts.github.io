title : "Artificial Intelligence, Biometrics, VR and Brain Surveillance"
---

<p>ThoughtWorks Arts is currently seeking an artist/technologist wishing to work on issues surrounding the design, use and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can enhance the human experience, but can also contribute towards amplifying pre-existing social prejudices and biases, thereby restricting the free flow of individuals, communities and entire populations in untold ways.</p>

<p>View the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2017-implications-of-ai/">open call here</a>, and also review <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/why-we-are-investigating-biases-artificial-intelligence/">this article from the Directors</a> explaining our perspective on this critical issue. Note that we have designed the call to be open-ended, so as to allow artists to surprise us with their proposals. Applications are due by June 8, 2017.</p>

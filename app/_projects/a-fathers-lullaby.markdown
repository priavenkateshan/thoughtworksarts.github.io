> A Father’s Lullaby centers on the homecomings of dozens of incarcerated men. Each one is a thread woven into a deeply affecting emotional whole. It is atmospheric, not linear, pieced together in a fluid patchwork of image and sound, longing and loss, mirroring the bleakly disconnected lives of families left without fathers and sons.

> The work’s power lies in its balance of immediacy and distance. Men are shot square on, from the shoulders up, with a simple black background.

As part of the residency rashin worked with Scatter to produce a new volumetric video portrait of one of the fathers, who describes the experience of returning to his adult childre, now in their 20s. “The main question from all of them is, ‘Why did you leave?’

The project is further supported through the creation of a website where fathers from across the USA upload recordings of their voices. Website visitors can browse and explore the voices via an interactive map, and XYZ.

Artist Rashin Fahandej says that A Father’s Lullaby is a "Poetic Cyber Movement for Social Justice, in which art and technology mobilizes a plethora of voices in public and virtual spaces to ignite an inclusive dialogue effecting social change."

The piece has awarded the James and Audrey Foster prize, was [exhibted at the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA)](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/institute-contemporary-arts-biennal-exhibits-rashin-fahandej-boston/) on the Boston waterfront on [DATES].

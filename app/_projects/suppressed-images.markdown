The graphic story was published at [suppressedimages.net](https://suppressedimages.net) in the final week of Barack Obama's presidency. The final pane of the story includes a speculative twist in which Chelsea's sentence is commuted &mdash; a twist which spectacularly came true.

The story was written by Chelsea Manning and Heather Dewey-Hagborg, and illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, a designer with ThoughtWorks India.

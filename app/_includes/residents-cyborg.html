	<h2>Cyborg Foundation</h2>
	<p>Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas are founders of the Cyborg Foundation.</p>
	<p>The foundation's mission is to help humans become cyborgs, to promote the use of cybernetics as part of the human body and to defend cyborg rights. The foundation believes that some cybernetic extensions should be treated as body parts, not as devices.</p>

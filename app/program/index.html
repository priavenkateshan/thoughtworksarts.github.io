			</header>

			<h2>Mission statement</h2>

			<p>The ThoughtWorks Arts Residency supports artists exploring new lines of inquiry intersecting technology and society.</p>

			<p>The program facilitates dialog, partnership and making between technical and exploratory art. By focusing on this synthesis, the program aims to empower resident artists to make work which inspires shifts in perspectives and debate.</p>

			<h2>How the program works</h2>

			<p>Artists attend the program at it's home in New York City for 16 week cycles. Once there, artists are introduced to ThoughtWorks culture and have the opportunity to present their ideas to staff and find potential collaborators.</p>

			<p>Throughout the program artists are supported with a regular stipend, project production support, access to the ThoughtWorks developer community, arts industry networking opportunities, and a New York exhibition at the end of their stay.</p>

			<p>Artists are free to choose how to spend their time and use these resources. Whatever artists make, including all physical and intellectual property, is owned by them. Artists are encouraged to share by publishing information about their work and ideas, running workshop sessions and a final presentation, and open-sourcing their technology.</p>

			<h2>ThoughtWorks</h2>

			<p>ThoughtWorks is a global community of technologists whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation and delivery, while advocating for positive social change. We are deeply aware of the constantly changing role technology plays in society and are driven to support and collaborate with those who are exploring the boundaries.</p>

			<p>Besides a core focus on software delivery, ThoughtWorks is engaged in a wide array of cross-cutting technology concerns, including security and privacy, emerging technology, the internet of things, machine learning and data science. Our agile approach to technology provides our clients the confidence and flexibility they need to make effective technology a core component of their business.</p>

			<h2>Residency Unlimited</h2>

			<p>Residency Unlimited supports the creation, presentation and dissemination of contemporary art through its unique residency program and year-round public programs. We forge strategic partnerships with collaborating institutions to offer customized residencies designed to meet the individual needs of participating artists and curators.</p>

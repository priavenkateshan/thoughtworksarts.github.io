		<h2>How it works</h2>
	</header>
	<p>Artists are invited spend 16 weeks in residence in New York, at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, a global technology consultancy. During their stay, artists receive project production support from a global network of analysts, designers, developers and other experts in the company.</p>
	<p>Residents are provided with a regular stipend during their stay. In addition, our partners at <a href="http://residencyunlimited.org">Residency Unlimited</a> support artists with regular curatorial visits and by arranging an exhibition of their work.</p>
	<p>ThoughtWorks runs the residency out of an desire to openly experiment, collaborate and share ideas with those asking hard questions about emerging technologies. Therefore, artists own all physical and intellectual property generated during their stay.</p>

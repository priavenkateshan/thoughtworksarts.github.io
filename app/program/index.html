	<p>The ThoughtWorks Arts Residency supports artists exploring new lines of inquiry intersecting technology and society.</p>

		<h2>How it works</h2>
	</header>
	<p>Artists are invited to be resident at the ThoughtWorks New York office for 16 week cycles of work. Interaction is facilitated between artists and the global network of analysts, designers, developers and other experts who are employees at ThoughtWorks.</p>
	<p>To ensure they are free to focus on thier project work, artists are supported with a regular stipend, project production support and a New York exhibition at the end of their stay.</p>
	<p>Whatever artists make, including all physical and intellectual property is owned by them, though they are encouraged to open source where possible. ThoughtWorks engages in this program purely from the cultural impulse to experiment, collaborate with and support pioneers.</p>

			<p>Together these programs cover a wide spectrum of modes of support, methods of inclusion, and nature of outcomes. They range from the open-access community support of Hardware Hack Lab, through the facilitated cross-disciplinary collaboration of Art-A-Hack, and into the deep, focused cutting edge issue research of the ThoughtWorks Arts Residency.</p>
			<p>Each program is driven by the central insight that art provides a <a href="/blog/how-artists-reshape-emerging-technology-research/">powerful lens for engaging with technology</a>, in particular because of its high degree of freedom in making large conceptual leaps across technical, industrial and societal domains, delivering often unexpected outcomes.</p>

      <p>ThoughtWorks Arts has <strong>published an open call</strong> for artists to explore the monopolization of artificial intelligence by a small number of corporate giants, the associated impacts on society, and alternatives in decentralized community ownership of the technology.</p>

<p>The residency, created in partnership with Mozilla Foundation and Snark.art, takes the <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> project as its starting point.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<h2 id=the-intelligence-commons>The Intelligence Commons</h2>
<p>SingularityNET was founded by Dr Ben Goertzel, who is also the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, which provides a platform for AI development in robots.</p>

<p>Goertzel has warned that AI development is currently controlled by a handful of corporations who have the mix of resources and incentives to invest in widescale research and development. Independent, open source and community-owned AI development cannot access this scale of resources and are not exposed to the same incentives. In fact, successful developers of open source projects have huge incentives to take their research to corporations, locking it away in closed systems.</p>

<p>The SingularityNET project offers a compelling alternative for independent developers. It acts as a marketplace for AI systems to be published an monetized, and also as an interoperability layer, connecting multiple “narrow” AIs into a broader community-owned intelligence. As <strong>the whitepaper</strong> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For example, if a text-to-speech AI and an Italian-to-English translation AI were both on the network, then the network as a whole would be capable of using Italian text to produce English speech. Within this framework, AI transforms from a corporate asset to a global commons; anyone can access AI tech or become a stakeholder in its development. Also, anyone can add an AI/machine learning service to SingularityNET for use by the network and receive network payment tokens in exchange.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By developing the interlinks between these components within a global commons, SingularityNET hopes to avert the specter of control and domination of AI by a few major corporations.</p>

<h2 id=looking-into-the-singularity>Looking Into the Singularity</h2>

<p>Whether in public and open source environments or closed behind corporate doors, the integration of “narrow” AIs paves the way toward the creation of general AIs.</p>

<p>As researchers like Ray Kurzweil have warned, this path leads towards the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity>technological singularity</a>, beyond which humans will struggle to keep up with the exponentially-advancing capabilities of AI.</p>

<p>The value systems, operatinal tendencies and explicit operational objectives of these systems as the sungularity approaches will have a huge influence of the nature of AI post-singularity. It is equally conceivable that a post-singularity-AI will be benevolent, as that it will be harmful.</p>

<p>The position of the SingularityNET Foundation is that “the benefits of AI should not accrue only to a small set of powerful institutions, but rather should be shared by all.” Further, they believe that “beneficial” AI should be incentivized.</p>

<hr>

<p>The simplest explanation of SingularityNET is that it is an AI marketplace. Users can discover and utilize various AI functionality, and developers can post AI systems for users and other developers to use.</p>

<hr>

<p>In response, have outlined a vision for how a decentralized marketplace of interoperable open source AI components could compete with major corporations and governments for control of artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p>While showing promise, this vision also covers a great deal of complexities.</p>

<hr>

<p>SingularityNET is backed by the SingularityNET Foundation (described in section 1.5), which believes that the benefits of AI should not accrue only to a small set of powerful institutions, but rather should be shared by all. A key goal of SingularityNET is ensuring that the technology is benevolent by human standards and that the network is designed to incentivize and reward beneficial players.</p>

<p>This is critical given the explicit aspiration of the project—alongside shorter-term practical and commercial goals—to play a central role in launching the technological singularity as foreseen by Vinge, Kurzweil, and others by catalyzing the emergence and economic pervasiveness of self-modifying, self-improving, self-understanding artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p>The SingularityNET platform, AI network, and ecosystem are works in progress, and are intended to remain so, the very essence of the singularity being rapid change. In this spirit, what you are reading is a substantial revision of SingularityNET’s first whitepaper. The first version was written in fall 2017 before the network’s initial token generation event, whereas this version was written in February 2019 and reflects what has been learned and built during the interim.</p>

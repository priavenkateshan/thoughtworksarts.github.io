It came about slowly as political events unfolded and connections were made.</p><p>At the beginning of her residency, Heather presented her work over a conference call to an audience of global ThoughtWorks employees. Shoili Kanungo, a graphic designer and illustrator with ThoughtWorks India, watched the call and got in touch to suggest a collaboration.</p><figure><a href="https://suppressedimages.net/"><img src=/images/posts/2017-01-18-suppressed-images-picturing-chelsea-manning/story-1.5d47.jpg alt="The first page of 'Suppressed Images'"></a><figcaption>The first page of 'Suppressed Images'</figcaption></figure><p>“She asked if she could help somehow and I started thinking about a graphic short story,” recalls Heather. “Time was short (this was less than a month ago) and we wanted to get something out before Obama left office.”</p><p>“I wrote an original draft of the narrative and sent that to Chelsea and to Shoili, along with some ideas of what the images might be. And then Chelsea really edited and rewrote and added lots of her own text, including rewriting the whole thing as a dialogue between the two of us.”</p><p>“I worked also with Shoili on interpreting these into images, and she did a really beautiful and original job on that. But it wasn’t easy! Shoili is in India, and Chelsea can only communicate through the mail and through a liaison, and we’re working on such a tight time-frame, so it was really intense.”</p><p>The work was published online and began circulating just a few days before the announcement came from the White House.</p><p>The full graphic story is available on <a href="https://suppressedimages.net/">suppressedimages.net</a>.</p></div></article><div class=progress><a href="/blog/" class="blog forwards">View all posts</a></div></section></main><footer><div class=subscribe><form class=newsletter-form action=https://tinyletter.com/thoughtworksarts method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit="window.open('https://tinyletter.com/thoughtworksarts', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true"><label for=tlemail>Keep up to date with residents and projects:</label><input type=email name=email id=tlemail value="your email" class=faded><input type=hidden value=1 name=embed><input type=submit value=Subscribe id=tlsubmit></form></div><ul class=social><li><a href=https://twitter.com/tw_arts><i class="fa fa-twitter" id=twitter></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thoughtworksarts/"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/thoughtworksresidency><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul><ul class=notices><li><a href=https://www.thoughtworks.com/privacy-policy>Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/javascript/script.a5cc.js></script></body></html>
